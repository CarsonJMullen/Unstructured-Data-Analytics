    "## Task C Insights (Lift Ratios for Brand Associations):\n",
    "\n",
    "Infiniti’s Strong Connection with Acura:\n",
    "\n",
    "The association between Acura and Infiniti shows the highest lift (2.37), which indicates that these brands are often discussed together. This could imply that Acura and Infiniti are perceived as direct competitors in the luxury car market. Additionally, Acura's other higher associations, such as with Cadillac (0.99) and Honda (1.28), highlight its presence across both luxury and near-luxury markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mercedes's Significant Comparisons: \n",
    "\n",
    "Mercedes has consistently strong associations with other luxury brands such as Audi, BMW, Cadillac, and Infiniti. The high lift values, especially between Mercedes and Audi (2.11), BMW (2.04), and Cadillac (2.31), reveal that these brands are often mentioned together on the Edmunds.com post. This  suggests that Mercedes is frequently mentioned along with other luxury brands, reflecting its strong presence among consumers shopping for high-end cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "BMW’s Significant Comparisons:\n",
    "\n",
    "BMW shows significant associations with Mercedes (2.04) and Cadillac (0.94). This suggests that consumers frequently compare BMW with other premium brands and vehicles. Conversely, BMW has a relatively weak associations with non-luxury brands, such as Honda and Toyota, which may indicate that its market positioning is firmly in the luxury segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audi's Significant Comparisons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Audi has strong associations with Mercedes (2.11) and Cadillac (1.18), indicating that it is also seen as a key competitor in the luxury market. However, its lift values with non-luxury brands (such as Toyota and Honda) are significantly lower, suggesting that Audi's market focus is predominantly among luxury brands, similar to BMW.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task D Insights (Multi-dimensional Scaling Map):\n",
    "\n",
    "Luxury Brands: Acura, BMW, Audi, Infiniti, Mercedes, and Cadillac are relatively close to each other in the MDS map, indicating that they are frequently perceived as competitors in the entry level luxury market. This suggests that consumers often compare these brands when making purchasing decisions, which aligns with their competitive positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Luxury Brands: Honda, Toyota, and Hyundai are positioned a bit farther from the core luxury brands. This suggests that these brands, while occasionally mentioned in the same context as luxury brands, are not seen as direct competitors in the same market. However, their positioning could indicate that they are sometimes viewed as alternatives for consumers newly entering the luxury market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Volkswagen as a Clear Outlier: Volkswagen is positioned significantly apart from the other brands, suggesting that it is not frequently considered in direct comparison with the core luxury brands or the non-luxury brands. This could imply that it's seen as neither a direct competitor in the premium/luxury market nor a strong alternative in the non-luxury segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Advice \n",
    "\n",
    "Since brands like Acura, BMW, Audi, Infiniti, Mercedes, and Cadillac can be seen as closely categorized as competitors, it could be advantageous for these individual brands to focus on differentiating themselves in aspects beyond the luxury element. By emphasizing a focus on new in-car technology, driving performance, or other specific features, these established, entry-level luxury brands can highlight their unique strengths to consumers and promote brand loyalty. \n",
    "\n",
    "Non-luxury brands like Honda, Toyota, and Hyundai can be more successful in the entry-level business by focusing on customers who are making the transition from mainstream to luxury. For instance, promoting premium features and sub-brands (e.g. Toyota's Lexus and Hyundai's Genesis) as \"beginner luxury\" alternatives can help establish Toyota and Hyundai as brands that are more associated with luxury. The focus on accessibility within luxury will not only appeal to entry-level luxury consumers but will attract customers who may not even be considering the higher-end automobile lifestyle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, since Volkswagen seems to lack a competitive presence in the luxury market, their brand can also position itself as an affordable premium option. By maintaining focus on value-conscious customers who are looking for high quality without the luxury price tag, Volkswagen can gain a more competitive edge in the luxury market. Promoting its European engineering and specific upscale models may also help in upgrading Volkswagen's customer perception in American audiences. "

In upscale German brands equipment levels is mostly a decision of a local dealer's inventory manager (within model allotments) and their view of the market. I've been following BMW's inventory at my local dealers once every so often and they can't be any different from each other. For example, one dealer may have majority of strippers ready for low-end leases, another may have mostly fully loaded stuff for 20 grand more. They may say they order \"what sells\", but nobody will convince me that markets 20 miles apart are so different from each other than you'll sell only white cars here and black cars there. It's all what these guys think sells and what they personally think looks nice and fits. It's all their taste and \"feel\". Then they sell it and as long as they hit their target, their confirmation bias will tell them they made correct decisions. If they don't, they'll blame slowdown, four seasons, drought, snow, rain, wrong Moon phase and current president of the United States. I don't think there is any science there at all.\n",

For instance, it says that maintenance and repairs for a Camry over 5 years will be about $4000, but my guess is that it would be about half of that (10 oil changes x $50 each =$500 + 4 tires for c.$1000 + 500 additional would be my estimate). The Tesla model was c. $39k on which no discounts are possible, but with a Camry for c.$25k you might get $4000 off of msrp, which they didn't indicate. So I feel like the study is about $6000 off in favor of the Tesla. Finally, although the Tesla battery has a 8 years/100,000 mile warranty, I'm wondering if you own the Tesla for 10 years and 150,000 or more miles if a new $8000 or so battery is likely to be needed.\n",

Sometimes it seems like for just a thousand or two more than an Accord with the same years and mileage you can pick up a 320i, an A4, or a TLX.

      "I've mentioned before that maybe the most interesting book on the auto industry I ever read is called \"Car: A Drama of the American Workplace\" by Mary Walton, published in 1999. This book was not about a luxury car, but instead about the second generation Taurus, which Ford was trying to push higher in the marketplace. Anyway, one of the memorable things about it for me was that—not surprisingly—every single part on a car goes through a tough process of figuring out what the cost and therefore quality of the part can be. Ford was trying to make the 1996 Taurus a car that people would buy without big rebates, and as it was first designed and for its first year they allowed a higher budget for the cost of various parts so they would feel nicer, and sometimes function better. When the 2nd gen Taurus flopped in the marketplace the project manager had to huddle with his designers and engineers and try to figure out in an almost brutal way how to take something like $1500 in costs out of the car, which involved getting cheaper parts here, there, and everywhere.\n",

The adaptive cruise controls etc. are easier and more intuitive to use in the Acura when compared with my wife's new CR-V with its small and comparatively cheap butttons.\n",

      "Given that both hardware and software components are in a state of constant revision, I can share some observations from the perspective of one who has a 2014 SQ5 (8-speed Tip) and a 2014 S4 (7-speed DSG) in captivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The programming of the Tip makes it the best iteration of the \"slush\" transmission -- as someone called it -- I've ever driven. The DSG is the smoothest transmission I've ever driven in that, when left in auto shift mode, the shifts are basically heard, not felt. I know the transmission has up-shifted by ear and by virtue of the drop of the tach needle, but the progression in feeling is unlike traditional torque converter auto transmissions and unlike manual transmissions. Both the Tip and the manual transmissions have a momentary disruption of forward momentum when the transmission decides to shift or when the driver depresses the clutch -- watching from the side, when either one of these transmissions is up-shifted, the heads of the driver and a front-seat passenger are momentarily \"thrown\" forward at the moment of the depression of the clutch or up-shift of the auto -- there is no such throwing or lurching with the DSG -- in fact in that ONE aspect, I would think the DSG could be said to be somewhat like a CVT. Somewhat, not much, but a little \"somewhat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Downshifting, again, is an area where the DSG excels -- when in full auto-mode \"S\"port shifting program, the DSG transmission rev matches to the imminent downshift and the \"second\" clutch engages with virtually no kick. Only a manual transmission even comes close to this, but having said that, the DSG is so much smoother on a rev-matching down shift it isn't even close.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I've driven the S4 (DSG), SQ5 (Tip) and S6 (DSG) equipped cars -- of the three, two of them are just that little bit better in terms of their shifting prowess and smoothness. Again, with all of the above subtleties stated for the record, it is apparent that someone at Audi (or whoever writes the software) has done everything they can to make virtually all of the \"dead giveaways\" that you are driving a Tip as invisible and imperceptible as possible. In short, unless you're really looking for HARD EVIDENCE that the SQ5 isn't a DSG, you might not really notice the SQ5 is not a DSG. Over time and with the availability (as I have) of two very very similar cars to drive back-to-back for comparison, well, you probably would be able to discern the subtle differences between the DSG and the Tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this stage of my own posterior meter, I can tell the difference between the DSG and the Tip -- the Tip, NOT the DSG has some hint of drivability issues and even placing the Tip in \"S\" all of the time doesn't completely wipe out the ever-so-slight shift hesitation and shift lurch behaviors, although you really have to be paying attention to notice them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not (yet) driven an RS7 -- frankly because I just don't think it is worth $120,000 (even if I had millions in the check book to do with as I please). I also don't think an S7 is worth $10,000 more than an S6 just for the body style. But I'm also the guy who resents an extra charge for \"paint\" beyond gloss black or gloss white.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bring the RS7 up, not to reveal my proclivities and, er, cheapness for things such as pearl paint colors, but to remind anyone who needs to know, that Audi puts the very specially programmed 8-speed Tip in the RS7. Several reviews of the car noted their assumption that the RS7 transmission was another very fine implementation of the DSG; and, then, noting later in their review how virtually imperceptible the Tip is from the DSG as executed in the RS7.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under full throttle in dynamic mode, both our S4 and SQ5 are prodigious accelerative forces of nature -- both of them emit the joyful \"PHLTTTBBB\" (aka fart sound) upon up-shift and when in S mode have quick paddle shift moves (but paddle-shifts are just a smidge quicker in the DSG, however).\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, were the Audi folk to gift me (fat chance) a 2017 MY S4 Prestige 8-speed Tip with a torque vectoring rear differential and with red leather seats, I would be a happy man. Of course, this is based on my assumption that the hardware and especially the shifting software of the 2017 S4 Tip had continued to move it even closer to the characteristics of a DSG (which appears to be the programmers goal).\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard that the BMW implementation of the dual-clutch auto did indeed have driveability issues -- but I have only heard that the Audi and Porsche implementation and programming of the DSG have few, if any, critics.\n",

Shortly after I got my license and had pretty much resigned myself to driving a 36HP stick shift car with a fabric sunroof and AM radio and a sort-of heater, dad traded \"up\" (?) for a Plymouth Valiant with a slant-6 engine and a “three on the tree” stick shift (and first gear was not synchronized).

Sony, a few short decades ago was the big buck TV (and later there were many other Sony branded electronics). Back in the day when big name department stores would sell TVs, a shopper could be in selection mode and see a sea of Zenith, RCA, Admiral and even Mitsubishi TVs -- often the Sony family of TVs was separated from the other brands; and, always the Sony brand in whatever size you were shopping for was more expensive. Time passed. Sony proliferated the brand and began lowering prices. Or did the competition creep their prices upward?\n",

      "The Lexus -- Land Grab -- approach also has its merits. In a B2C model, I would assume the Lexus approach seems \"intuitively\" to be lower risk.

One possibility is, if they are truly capable of having superior product and financially ready to back up lower volumes, they may attempt to hop over Germans, who are going in an opposite direction, by making their brand more accessible. How difficult is that? Extremely. Even if they can make a product that beats the Germans, the logistical problems are multifold - their dealer network is too big for the lower volumes of \"exlusive brand\", they would have to let go many (which costs money in broken contracts), they will need to shutter or repurpose plants (which costs money) and the risk is the downward spiral may still continue (people see sales falling so they don't wont to join the \"losers\" club).

      "The trick was in the tax structure, favoring diesels. That tax structure was justified by a doctored science, making the diesel engine look like a savior of the environment (vs. evil gasoline engine) due to lower carbon emissions, with nitrogen and particulate data using emission tests that were set up to produce appearance of much lower emissions than real life. As a result, the measured nitrogen oxide and particulate levels in cities did not go down and they tracked it to the emission test overstating the reduction of those emissions. In essence, if new diesel emission standards were followed using real life tests (similar to those in the US), there would be materially fewer engines certified in the marketplace (just like in the US), and those approved would be much more expensive. Hence the \"con\". There are some other interesting particulars in diesel market in Europe - like particulate filters that are often cut out by rogue drivers, because their replacement is horribly expensive, which defeats the purpose of the filter (this is more Eastern Europe phenomenon than Western). Also, it has been well documented that durability of those new breeds of diesel engines is well below what it was before and the maintenance is horribly expensive. Premature failures of double mass wheels, emission systems (especially in situations of frequent short trips, when particulate filters don't have a chance to burn out), increased sensitivity to fuel quality, make those engines equally or even more fragile than gas engines. The old stinker could go for million miles on vegetable or heating oil, the new quiet, \"clean\" diesel, has a lifespan similar or sometimes shorter than the gas engine with higher costs of overhauls. The prices of diesel repairs of those new TDI engines at authorized garages are legendary over there (it's not unique to VAG, same happens to MB, BMW, Peugeot, or Renault).\n",

I believe once new enforcement is in place and costs of engines go up, the proportions of diesel engines in small cars will revert to values similar to those prior the whole craze, which is more than in the US, but much less than today. The move is already happening, primarily due to equalized diesel fuel prices (that used to be much cheaper), observed increased maintenance cost and lower durability (majority of Europeans, even in the West buy cars for eight-ten years, not three or five), but tightening the standard will likely accelerate it.\n",

      "The '14 S4 I ordered came with the no-cost optional all-season tires. The tire specification was, on my part, deliberate since, living in Cincinnati -- the home of typically \"moderate\" winters -- I know I can't get away with \"summer only\" shoes year 'round. My previous A4 with the sport option came with 19\" wheels and summer only tires, which were great except for two things: 1 - they suck at any temperature below 40; and, 2 - the tread life of the Max Performance Summer Only tires that Audi chose was, optimistically not much north of 11,000 miles. This time, I thought I'd go with an S4 with the A/S's -- and I assumed since I was ordering an \"S\" car, the all-season tires would be the best of the best UHP A/S's on the market, probably Continentals or Michelins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bzzz! Thanks for playing, but the correct answer is that the tires on the car were \"H\" rated Grand Touring tires, albeit from Continental. The main characteristic of these GT tires was that they were very quiet. Otherwise they seemed out of place, somewhat, on an S4 -- the phrase \"under-tired\" springs to mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had, prior to driving my wife's SQ5 off the lot had Continental DWS UHP tires put on the 20\" wheels, and these tires were (considering they were UHP A/S's) a true pleasure, the best of both worlds, if that is even possible.\n",

      "So, here we are about 2 years later (my how time flies), she with 40,000+ miles on the SQ and me with 30,000+ miles on the S4 deciding that we had gotten what we wanted out of the tires on our respective S cars.\n",

      "\n",
      "For a 100% back-to-back commentary, we'll have to wait until we can drive in on DWS's and drive out on DWS 06's -- but my impressions of these tires on the S4 are from the context of driving in on Grand Touring slightly stiff sidewall tires and driving out on UHP very stiff sidewall tires (and, now that I've passed 50 miles, the slickness is gone).\n",
      "\n",
      "The DWS 06's if you need (or want) all-seasons have transformed the responsiveness of the S4 from very good to \"I can't believe this is even the same car\" great. Additionally, these tires are even quieter than the outgoing GT's and even the \"jolts\" felt when hitting potholes are now, somehow, felt as if through some kind of energy absorbing compound (flubber perhaps?)\n",

She remarked how unfazed the SQ was under the circumstances. And, if you recall, she had just come from 40,000 miles on the previous gen DWS (sans 06) tires. For her the improvement in the DWS 06's vs the DWS is noticeable but not \"night and day\" noticeable; for me, on the other hand, coming from H rated Continental Grand Touring's, the DWS 06's absolutely have transformed the car into what it should have been from mile one.\n",

      "Just because an American customer wants all-season tires, does not mean, nor does it even suggest, that the customer expects anything less than the highest performance tires available at the time the car is screwed together at the factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly (to me at least) many folks on the other side of the pond don't get some American driver's choice to wear one set of shoes on the car year 'round. When we buy a premium sport-performance sedan -- and request all-season tires -- no where is it written that the performance capabilities of the tires should drop from ultra-high or max performance all the way down to \"H\" rated family sedan fitments. Yet, today's UHP A/S tires are a compromise -- but time and technology have advanced to a point where a tire like Continental's DWS 06 UHP A/S can provide a performance envelope virtually equal to and in some cases greater than some Max Performance tires.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not argue that these tires are fungible with any Extreme Performance or even most Max Performance tires -- but the DWS 06's give up virtually no ground to many other UHP summer-only tires and, as noted can sometimes match the performance of Max Perf models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moral, if there is one, of the story is if, like me, you don't want -- for several reasons, including \"wheel wear from tire swapping\" -- to change your tires back and forth between summer and winter tires AND you live in an area of \"moderate\" -- not heavy -- snow, these UHP All-Seasons are \"the best you can get\" [today] (until a better one comes along the day after tomorrow -- probably from Michelin).\n",

      "Bingo. There is something in current American culture that prevents people from waiting for anything. That was not how the country was founded, but it is, how it evolved. Instant gratification is so entrenched that people would rather get a different color, no sunroof, or ugly (in their opinion) wheels rather than wait for what they actually want. One would think that products of such high value would be carefully selected and purchased to the specification of the customer, but the waiting seems almost \"unamerican\". I literally had to deal with blank stares and puzzled looks from all involved, from sales people, to coworkers, when I said I (want to or) ordered my car and it will come in couple of months. \"Why would you wait?\", they asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think there is a strong feedback loop in this - people want an instant gratifications, so the dealers and manufacturers adjusted to that world view by taking large inventories of product (nowhere else in the world car dealers have such enormous inventory) - which in turn conditions them to attempt to push for sales of what they already have (financing cost of the inventory) rather some future product that may even get canceled. Sale can be really booked when when the product and funds changes hands, not when order is made and just a small deposit is made. The finality of spot delivery gives a lot of incentives to everybody involved to accept what is there, rather than what may be there. This of course creates sales people with blank stares and puzzled looks when they meet a \"pickey\" cutomer (like me), who wants an exact color, style and options and is willing to wait for it. Customers know that, too and they know their power of instant gratification works the other way, as well as their own. Unit taken off the lot today, is one with no more financing cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always read that an ordered car should be less expensive than one from the lot, because it's not financed. This is true in theory, but the psychology works in exactly opposite direction. The sales people act like they're making you a favor by accepting a future order rather than taking the car from the lot (and for reasons stated above, they may even believe that), which means you should pay for that \"favor\". If you were more \"accommodating\" to their immediate needs (take one unit from the lot), they may be more \"accommodating\", too. As a result, some people who would be willing to wait hear they could get extra $1000 off the car on the lot (even if it doesn't make any sense from cost-plus point of view), so they adjust their expectation and take one with a different color or wrong options, just so they can believe they got a better deal. It even works for them long term, as such a customer, who bought a \"deal\" may be more willing to accelerate next purchase, as they may never get over that color, or those wrong options.\n",

Even those who do not build their houses from the dirt up typically shop until they find the facing and floor-plan that satisfies certain criteria.

The perception is that the higher performing models from Audi, BMW and Mercedes (just to name the Germans for an example) now offer AWD virtually if not literally and I think we're closing in on literally, across their entire lines. Porsche, clearly not an LPS generally speaking, has 20 different cars for sale all called 911's -- I believe they are all offered with AWD.

As time passed we graduated to cars that came with 3 seatbelts in the front (unless you had bucket seats), then rear seatbelts, then shoulder belts then seatbelt interlocks that essentially attempted to force seatbelt use as the cars would not start unless the seatbelts were fastened (leading to folks fastening their seatbelts, then sitting on them, therefore defeating the purpose.)\n",

Still don't care for the steering. Yes, the car actually goes where I want it to go (suspension seems to be responsive and compliant enough), but lack of the feedback is pretty significant for anybody who ever owned cars like Subaru WRX, or previous 3-series, especially like mine, with sport suspension. Every time after those couple of days, or a test-drive of other 3-series derivatives in the market, including 335 or 435 (those were with MSport lines), I'm glad I can get back behind the wheel of my 328 wagon. It's not as fast, or fuel efficient, may be even a bit noisier, but the steering feedback feel is far superior. Why BMW changed it? Two reasons - fuel and market demand. The second one came from their desire to sell more and more units. The more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average Joe, even if Joe has more than average income. Americans like things soft, I cru through tears every time I read those comments about \"such harsh\" suspension on sport package, they clearly never drove Audi, whose \"sport suspensions\" generally consist of stones in places of springs .

      "\n",
      "Here goes: many, probably most of these cars tend toward -- or outright already have -- some degree of nose heaviness. Audi is certainly not known for \"50 - 50\" weight balance, for instance. Acura, Volvo and most certainly others (again not BMW) are absolutely nose heavy when configured as 2WD vehicles (since they mostly are FWD when ordered thusly). More and more of these ELLP vehicles are ordered every year with 4-driven wheels (the up take here in SW Ohio is now for \"mostly\" AWD versions -- even most BMW's and Mercedes are acquired with AWD so say the dealers). Alas, even the AWD versions are nose-heavy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing that I've learned that is a quick, easy and virtually free way to improve upon some of the effects of being a bit porky on the front is to inflate the front tires +2 pounds more than the rear tires; and, typically to inflate the fronts to one or two pounds MORE than the factory sticker suggests.\n",
      "\n",
      "My S4 says to inflate the tires at max to 42 pounds. I inflate front to 43 and rear to 41 (using the free nitrogen \"air\" Costco offers its members).\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a cold snap here in River City yesterday -- of course the air pressure in all four tires dropped dramatically -- we went from 70+ degrees to overnight temps in the upper teens with a daytime high an optimistic 41.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I was at Costco getting my fill up of their Top-Tier premium, I also went for the free air fill-up. Based on the length of time before the \"ding\" indicating 43 pounds, the pressure had to have been over 5 or 6 pounds below that.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure the tires were cold, I drove to Costco, parked and went shopping in the store for a while, then went to the tire dept for my fill-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I kid you not -- and I've known this for years, yet I was as pleasantly surprised as could be -- the turn-in was IMMEDIATELY sharper, like the car had been placed on a set of shiny new rails.\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, that is the \"free\" (as in almost zero cost) tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's one, that when coupled with the above free tip, will further dramatically improve your heavy nosed (and this one works on any car) ELLP vehicle's steering dynamics: switching out of the factory tires (unless certain tires are already on your ELLP car) into the top of the line performance tires in the class (of tire) that you would normally drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example -- here in SW Ohio -- no one (well, virtually no one) uses \"summer\" and \"winter\" tires -- they use either \"summer\" tires year round or (more likely) all-season tires, year round.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Germans have even gone so far as to specify as no cost options, typically, the ability to order your car with summer only or all season rubber. Dealers typically order their for-stock vehicles with all-season rubber to keep their customers from complaining about the super fast tire wear and the almost unusable traction summer tires offer to those of us who do have temps that go below 40 - 45 degrees from time to time (our typical winters are usually above freezing, but usually below 45 which is the kryptonite temp for summer only tires).\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, a lot of the \"all-season\" tires are either Grand Touring tires or are simply H rated all-seasons (generally from a well-known brand and generally with a fairly long tread-life expectation).\n",
      "\n",
      "My S4 came with H rated Grand Touring tires. What were they thinking? Offered up to order is an S4 with either summer or all-season tires. I checked the all-season box since, well, you know, I live in Cincinnati and we really (usually) have very mild winters in terms of both temp and snowfall. Why do I need dedicated winter tires in my climate, so to speak?\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grand Touring tires are fine -- but, if you ax' me they have no business on an Audi S car of any stripe.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is better -- much much better? Easy-peasy: an Ultra-High Performance All-Season tire from one of the name brands all of the German's buy from. We ended up with Continental ExtremeContact DWS Ultra High Performance All-Seasons from Tire Rack -- shipped to the dealer, installed and road-force balanced. These tires should have their picture placed beside the word \"sticky\" in your Merriam-Webster.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have super-stiff (compared to the rather comfy-biased Grand Touring H rated rubber that the S4 came with) sidewalls and they are Y speed-rated. Of course, since I ordered my car with the all-season tire option, Audi saw fit to engage a max-speed limiter that tops out at 130 (easily switched off, if you really think you're going to need to exceed 130MPH).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you can, for relatively little money (close to zero) noticeably improve your ELLP's turn-in, gas mileage and overall handling by simply cranking up the fronts to +2 pounds over the rears and by cranking up the front 1 or 2 pounds over the door jam's \"suggestion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then for what will probably amount to $700 to $1,000 all-in (but for some of these cars that you can order 20\" wheels, the $ amount will be higher), you can take the next big step and get rid of the almost certainly \"wimpy\" tires the manufacturers seem to put on these cars when the \"no summer only\" tire option is checked.\n",

      "For the moment, let's say the ELLPS class is solidly where the new A3 belongs, To me, that seems to suggest the A4 (and the 2016 A4 leaps to mind) is no longer an ELLPS, nor is it an LPS, since the A6 is the representative of the LPS entry from Audi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, two LPS classes used to be sufficient -- but over the past few years car companies have scrambled to \"find a hole\" in the market and create a new car model to plug it. And, no hole seems either too big or too little -- model proliferation is the norm these days.\n",

      "Audi and BMW (and Mercedes too) have become the masters of model proliferation, it seems.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, just about \"everybody\" demonstrates \"wheelbase\" [or overall length] and girth growth every time they birth the new generation of a model. The BMW 3, for instance, has grown so much so that it is, in many ways, larger than a not-that-old 5 series. The current A4 used to be the size of the new A3 -- and when the current A4 was introduced in the US as a 2009 model it's wheelbase was within a fraction of an inch of the size of the then current A6. I know, I had a 2005 A6 that I kept for 6 months after the lease ended so that I could move to the new A4 and not have any period of time where I was not in an Audi. When the 2009 A4 came in to the dealer, I pulled my A6 up beside it -- and it was virtually impossible to tell the difference between the two with respect to wheelbase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The A4 got big! Then, when the new gen A6 came out, it, of course, grew in size -- the A3 was in the pipeline (not the 2009 A3, which was essentially a VW) and what we have in the brand new A3 is a car that plugs the hole left by the move up of the A4 into what used to be the size class of the A6, Numerous examples of this phenomenon can be cited for the cars that come from BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac and Lexus.\n",

      "So, assuming we all accept the notion that three LPS classes are now appropriate, we move the current (and certainly 2016's upcoming) A4, 3 series and C class (while were sticking with the Germans) to the ILLPS forum and open up the new, 'blank slate', ELLPS board (forum) for cars like the new Audi A3, BMW 2 series (which may be problematic since it doesn't have 4-doors as far as I know) and the Mercedes CLA (which is a 4-door coupe, according to MB). We move the CTS firmly to the LPS forum and put the ATS in with the ILPS cars if its wheelbase (among other things) doesn't force it into the ELLPS class.\n",

      "When I pulled up to the sidewalk and parked in the No Parking zone, the boys’ bicycles were on their kick stands under the porte cochère at the back of the public library where the night drop off for books and, in my case, DVD’s is located. The library wouldn’t be open for more than an hour, so I assumed the boys were just there to get out of the hot morning sun. I put the DVD’s into the slot, nodded at the boys and turned around heading back to my idling car. Just about when I got to the driver’s door, one of the boys said “How much did that [car] cost?” I replied, “How much do you think?” The young man and his friend yelled back in unison, “A lot!” I told them it cost about $57,000, and I heard oo’s and ah’s in response. I drove off, giving them a quick honk and a wave.\n",
      "What’s the point?\n",
      "The point is, I’ve been thinking, saying and writing about what I assumed is the pending death of the automobile as most of us here know and love it. I’ve been of that opinion because it seems to me that virtually anyone under the age of 35 (or maybe under-30) seems as if they could care less about cars beyond them being appliances or means to get from point-to-point. These “young people” wouldn’t or couldn’t talk about cars if you threatened them with pain and death, and wouldn’t even bother to feign interest to win the new not-yet-released iPhone 6, so little interest do these folks seem to have in cars. These two young men gave me hope!\n",
      "Now, I’ll bet when you and I were in our formative (‘tween through teen-age) years, we had but several topics we cared to opine about: Cars, Girls [or boys] and Sex. I my case, I was a budding audiophile, too, which kind of rounded out the whole emerging nerd stereotype. Had there been personal computers (of any stripe) or video games available (it was the early to mid-60’s and such tech had not yet been introduced to the mainstream market), I most certainly would’ve been into them; but instead I was into “stereo” in addition to cars, girls and sex (talking about sex, not actually having it, of course).\n",
      "So when I was with my buds, the topic was often the “cars we were gonna be driving” as soon as we turned 16. We were dreamers, of course – we, then, were the kids sitting at the library entrance (where else?) watching the guy drive up in his new 1965 Bonneville pillar-less four-door painted in dark blue metallic with a ton of chrome accents and shiny chrome hub-caps and big ol’ tires (white walls, of course).\n",
      "“Hey mister, how much did that thing cost?” The reply, at the time, was “About $4,000,” and of course we then obliged by making the same oo and ah sounds like the ones I heard the other morning.\n",
      "My overarching point to this erudite group of auto enthusiasts here at Edmunds is that I believe we are pretty much smitten with cars and everything to do with them – but that we’re also mostly predisposed to acquire one of these Premium (or near-premium) Class cars based on history, loyalty or perhaps even looks. I would submit if you’ve had more than one representative of the same brand (back to back), that your next car is perhaps pre-ordained to come from that manufacturer. Loyalty to a brand is – along with several other characteristics – another sign that you are passionate about cars. You’ve come to identify yourself with BMW’s (a quite common occurrence here in Cincinnati) – you are a “BMW guy”. My friend, now President of his second software company had an Acura when I met him. In our times in the car often driving from Cincinnati to Chicago or to Bowling Green (KY), he would go on and on about what I’m convinced must be the best car in the world – at least he certainly thought so: the BMW M5. This guy was about 10-years my junior.\n",
      "Thankfully he didn’t have to keep the Acura long – so less than a year after I met him he leased his first (of many) BMW’s – a 3-series. Followed by a 5, then a 7 then one of the “Z” car convertibles (he called that one Penis).\n",
      "I submit that most of us here are (or want to be) “XXX” guys (intended to be gender neutral, don’t you know). You’re a Mercedes maven, you’re a BMW bigot and I’m an Audi aficionado. No matter what “empirical” data is brought to bear, you’re sure your new IS 350 F-Sport is superior to that guy’s BMW 328 – after all, Car & Driver says so; and, you just know you can run circles around the Bimmer’s 4-cylinder, turbo and all.\n",
      "So it is with the foreknowledge that no matter how much evidence I can produce to the contrary, you will remain steadfast that your own sagacity has been validated and put on display for all to see by your choice of the latest and greatest Volvo S60 (or whatever).\n",
      "So where does that leave us?\n",
      "With hope, I hope.\n",
      "The upcoming generation still needs to ratchet up their passion for all things automotive – or we could be doomed to forever being but passengers in our autonomous vehicles. But, I think there is some evidence, not much, but a little, that there are kids who are just as interested in cars as they are video games, social media (and, hopefully, sex).\n",
      "There may be some hope, too, that those of “us” who may not as of yet yet been inculcated by a Brand of automobile, may find our personal automotive archetype and to coin a phrase, “Live long and prosper.”\n",
      "I’ll close by saying this: While I still remain convinced that the Audi S4 is the best representative of the Entry-level Luxury Performance Sedan (and for the money it damn well ought to be), I must say, after having visited the Acura dealer to “See what’s new,” that the new TLX SH-AWD in Advance trim (the one with the 6-cylinder), ought to be this category’s leader if “price” (MSRP) is factored in. If you haven’t checked out this exact configuration (I can’t offer the same praise for the lesser TLX’s), I urge you to do so before you spend one dime on a new ELLPS car – this thing (the 2015, to be clear) is IMPRESSIVE!\n",

We thought long and hard about taking a test drive of either a 2014 A6 3.0T or a 2015 A6 2.0T with the sport package and lots of options. Both of these cars were on the lot and not “sold” cars. My wife asked me what I really, really wanted to drive, now, if I could only drive one car, I immediately answered a new “S6” – that was easy.\n",
      "A few minutes after walking in the showroom door, we were handed the keys to a 2014 S6 with about 300 miles on the OD and with a few choice options: cold weather package, black wood and aluminum trim, black interior and panther black exterior. Also present: 20” wheel upgrade (from the standard 19” inchers). Since the designation of the S6’s is now Prestige, there were very few features the car didn’t have – it did not have the top view camera for example, or the automatic cruise control including stop and go, etc.\n",
      "To my eye, I sat down, behind the wheel of The Batmobile (the color combo having a lot to do with that) and pressed the start button only to be immediately more than a little impressed by the “awakening.” Unfortunately, this car was an S6, not an S5, RS5 or even S4. I say unfortunately because the car was clearly focused 90% on the luxury side of sport-luxury. This became even more evident when I put the car into drive (which means “S” or sport mode since I had set the steering and air suspension to Dynamic (along with the engine and transmission) using Audi-Drive-Select. I ultimately changed the steering to Auto mode which gives the car super easy turns at slow speed, but tightens things up considerably as the MPHs climb.\n",
      "Speaking of climbing, I got onto a nearby Interstate (I-275 by-pass, eastbound) and was cruising along at a steady 60MPH – when all of a sudden, I floored the S6 and counted to three (one, two, three) – I counted pretty quickly too -- certainly 1, 2, 3! (think Sia) -- in less than three seconds. I released the accelerator completely and looked down at the speedometer only to see an indicated 102MPH. The sensation I had was, well, muted, subdued, suppressed – sublime. There was virtually no drama, barely any sound (angry engine or otherwise) lingered at all, and I was coasting down but still showing an indicated 90+-something on the speedo.\n",
      "What did I do next? Well, I “punched” the accelerator pedal for another Sia-like one-two-three moment, signaled right for the rapidly rushing at me exit ramp, hit the ramp at incredible speed, barely “mashed” the brake pedal only to get a momentary sensation that the S6 had impossibly instantaneously scrubbed off about 80 miles per hour (and almost magically seemed to be going backwards the descent was that swift) as I damn near just coasted to a stop as if nothing had happened 1-second ago. Meanwhile, I awaited the traffic-light to glow green.\n",
      "I tried out the S6’s handling envelope using my completely accurate and totally made up (therefore unscientific) routine of driving faster and faster and faster in a circle, then carving through an imaginary slalom barely nicking those [also imaginary] orange cones. The thing carves like a hot knife through buttah! A little, not much, body roll – but hey, this thing is a full-sized vehicle, remember.\n",
      "Here’s the thing, after my test drive – during which time I became thoroughly smitten – I drove (in sequence) our 2014 SQ5 and next up our 2014 S4. Now, I read the mfgr’s published 0-60 numbers for all three of these “S” vehicles, and the S6 is, after all, the quickest of the three, on-paper. The thing is my $58,000 S4 is very quiet, too, and I have the upgraded seats (which certainly seem very similar to the S6’s) further blurring the differences -- between the S4 and S6. My B&O sound system edges out the S6’s Bose system by a small but discernable difference, especially in the clarity department – the B&O tweeters are really impressive, the Bose’s less so.\n",
      "The S6 however, commands, no, demands your attention – much more so than the Ibis White S4, which seems to have a bit less “presence” than the Panther Black S6.\n",
      "Regarding the S6: I want one, I want one, I want one – and for perhaps $68-$70,000 (as equipped), I would actually say the value is really there. The thing is, however, the bottom line on the sticker was $79,500+. It (the S6) just didn’t seem to be THAT much more car, even though it would be worth considering hocking the family jewels and taking out a second mortgage.\n",
      "I loved the S6, I mean I really loved the car – it just isn’t worth (to me), as far as I can tell, $22,000 more than my S4 or $19,000 more than my wife’s SQ5. With an emphasis on more performance, I would possibly see where the money went – however, the emphasis is on luxury, isolation and stealth.\n",
      "Where the S4 is an iron fist with a velvet glove on it, the S6 is an iron fist wrapped in thick density foam with a velvet glove on it. I guess for nearly 80 grand, folks might well prefer stealth to show-off. I think I get that.\n",
      "Me? Well let’s just say, I’d like a bit more sturm und drang.\n",

Same holds true for sports cars, super cars and exotics -- they are (or must be to not be posers) RWD or AWD.

I would hope we all want to get the most we can for our dollar, and I assume we do.

From stoplight-to-stoplight, it would be rather nice to use less gas, and it’s equally nice to spend less money. The 36-month lease payment is $50 less for the 320i than that for the 328i, and even though the latter is much quicker and potentially faster, you won’t miss that sitting in traffic.
