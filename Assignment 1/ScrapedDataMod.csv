"punchline is: ""He Took Tips!"" tip either owners contemplating one ELLPS ELLPSUV/CUV's -- assuming vehicle question BMW. goes: many, probably cars tend toward -- outright already -- degree nose heaviness. Audi certainly known ""50 - 50"" weight balance, instance. Acura, Volvo certainly others (again BMW) absolutely nose heavy configured 2WD vehicles (since mostly FWD ordered thusly). ELLP vehicles ordered every year 4-driven wheels (the take SW Ohio ""mostly"" AWD versions -- even BMW's Mercedes acquired AWD say dealers). Alas, even AWD versions nose-heavy. thing I've learned quick, easy virtually free way improve upon effects bit porky front inflate front tires +2 pounds rear tires; and, typically inflate fronts one two pounds factory sticker suggests. S4 says inflate tires max 42 pounds. inflate front 43 rear 41 (using free nitrogen ""air"" Costco offers members). cold snap River City yesterday -- course air pressure four tires dropped dramatically -- went 70+ degrees overnight temps upper teens daytime high optimistic 41.

Here's one, coupled free tip, dramatically improve heavy nosed (and one works car) ELLP vehicle's steering dynamics: switching factory tires (unless certain tires already ELLP car) top line performance tires class (of tire) would normally drive. example -- SW Ohio -- one (well, virtually one) uses ""summer"" ""winter"" tires -- use either ""summer"" tires year round (more likely) all-season tires, year round. Germans even gone far specify cost options, typically, ability order car summer season rubber. Dealers typically order for-stock vehicles all-season rubber keep customers complaining super fast tire wear almost unusable traction summer tires offer us temps go 40 - 45 degrees time time (our typical winters usually freezing, usually 45 kryptonite temp summer tires). thing is, lot ""all-season"" tires either Grand Touring tires simply H rated all-seasons (generally well-known brand generally fairly long tread-life expectation).
